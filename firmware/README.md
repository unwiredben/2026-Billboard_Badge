# Build notes (lv_micropython)

You should not need to go through this unless you want to modify the LVGL
behavior or add addional compiled C modules. Most hacking is effective just in 
micropython (the .py files), which is much easier.

Install esp-idf: https://github.com/lvgl/lv_micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md#setting-up-the-toolchain-and-esp-idf
`./install.sh` and `. ./export.sh` in the shell that will be doing builds.

In `firmware/lv_micropython/ports/esp32` run `make BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=BILLBOARD_BADGE`  to build and `python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size 16MB --flash_freq 80m 0x0 build-ESP32_GENERIC_S3-BILLBOARD_BADGE/bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x8000 build-ESP32_GENERIC_S3-BILLBOARD_BADGE/partition_table/partition-table.bin 0x10000 build-ESP32_GENERIC_S3-BILLBOARD_BADGE/micropython.bin` to flash.
You will need to `make clean BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=BILLBOARD_BADGE` (yes including the arguments) to rebuild. The BOARD argument defines a build directory, so clean won't clean the correct directory without it.

Flashing the pre-built bin files: From `firmware/` run `python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size 8MB --flash_freq 80m 0x0 bin/bootloader.bin 0x8000 bin/partition-table.bin 0x10000 bin/micropython.bin`. To get into the mode to flash this, you need to hold down the BOOT button while either plugging in or pressing and releasing RESET.

## lv_micropython changes:
Copy the files from `firmware/lv_files/` to their matching paths, ex: `lv_files/foo/` -> `lv_micropython/foo/`.


## Optional B1 gray support

Ordinary `display.update()`, `display.draw_png(...)`, and LVGL flushes keep
upstream black/red/white behavior. Gray is explicitly requested per render and
refresh; its waveform module and tables load only when used.

`display.supports_grayscale` identifies supported B1 panels. The 84 panel keeps
its ordinary rendering; applications must select that fallback before requesting
a gray mode. Gray requests on unsupported panels raise `ValueError`.

For four colors, use `mixed=True` consistently:

```python
from lib.epd import display

# After creating and invalidating your LVGL screen:
if display.supports_grayscale:
    display.refresh_lvgl(mixed=True)
    display.update(mixed=True)
else:
    display.refresh_lvgl()
    display.update()
```

`refresh_lvgl()` calls LVGL's immediate refresh and restores the conversion mode
even if rendering fails. It does not start the physical panel refresh.
`draw_png(path, mixed=True)` supports gray in palette/grayscale PNGs. Match its
mode to the later `update(mixed=True)` call. RGB565 text edges and PNG samples
map to black below 96, gray below 204, and white otherwise; red remains red in mixed
mode. This produces one physical gray tone, not a full grayscale ramp.

Applications drawing directly into the two existing framebuffers can use:

| Color in mixed mode | Black-plane bit | Red-plane bit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| White | 0 | 0 |
| Black | 1 | 0 |
| Red | 0 | 1 |
| Gray | 1 | 1 |

The mixed refresh first draws an ordinary color image with gray sites cleared
to white, then prepares those sites with six white pulls and paints gray with
three pulls while holding other pixels. The app's buffers are not modified.
The existing ordinary interpretation of overlapping black/red bits is unchanged
when mixed mode is not requested.

For pages with no red, `grayscale=True` selects the faster black/white/gray
path: the second plane represents gray instead of red. Use it consistently in
`refresh_lvgl`, `draw_png`, and `update`; do not combine it with `mixed=True`.
Unknown or previously colored panel content receives a full white cleanup first.

Custom waveform waits are bounded and check both display controllers. Updates
queued during a refresh coalesce into the latest requested image and mode.

## Optional smooth text

Set `"smooth_text": true` in `/data/panel_config.json` to enable gray
antialiasing in the schedule apps on B1 panels.

The 14px softer-edge and 16px hinted Montserrat fonts load only when requested.
Missing fonts fall back to the built-ins. Other apps can use
`lib.smooth_text.load_font(filename, fallback)`. It keeps font storage alive,
prefers the native loader, and supports the portable `lib.binfont` loader.
To render gray edges, use the display render and update APIs described above.
For scenes containing red, select mixed mode.

See `badge/data/fonts/README.txt` for the font license, pinned build tools, and
reproduction commands. The generator verifies the expected output hashes.

## B1 red-only refresh

After an ordinary successful refresh, an application may repaint the current
red plane and apply red additions/removals while holding pixels that remain
non-red:

```python
display.red.pixel(x, y, 1)
display.update(red_only=True)
```

Removing red restores the color selected by the current black plane (black when
its bit is 1, white when it is 0). Existing red pixels are actively refreshed,
even when the red framebuffer has not changed. Changes to black pixels that
were not red are intentionally ignored by a red-only refresh. The first
red-only request after boot, after an error, or after a grayscale/mixed refresh
performs a normal full refresh to establish a known baseline. If neither the
previous nor current image contains red, the panel hardware is not started.

Red-only refresh is supported on the B1 panel only and cannot be combined with
`grayscale=True` or `mixed=True`.

To optimize the refresh to red additions and removals only, also request
`changed_only=True`. Unchanged red pixels are then held, and a request with no
red transitions does not start the panel hardware:

```python
display.update(red_only=True, changed_only=True)
```

`changed_only=True` without `red_only=True` raises `ValueError`.
